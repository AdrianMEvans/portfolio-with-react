        <h4>Where am I from?</h4>
        <p>
        I grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. After studing Bcom(Law) at the University of Pretoria I moved to Johannesburg before moving to the South Coast of the Western Cape. In Dec 2017 I relocated to Australia and have been a Perth local since.

        <h4>Things I like To Focus On</h4>
        <p>
        At work I love all things marketing and sales. I enjoy creative thinking and finding solutions. When not at work I love spending time with my family, being outdoors walking, jogging, cycling and kayaking.        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>On my radar</h4>
        <p>
        I like how websites can be functional and creative at the same time. Finding back end solutions to problems and presenting those solutions to the user with a smart and good-looking front end is an apealing challenge to me.        </p>
